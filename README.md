This is a Conway's Game Of life clone created using Python, Arcade, Pyglet and compute shaders.

- Really fast because computation happens on the GPU and data grid stays within GPU
- .rle, Life 1.05, Life 1.06 loading support
- .rle export support
- Discord RPC
- Basic Controller Support
- GPLv3 License, so you can use my code in your open source project!
